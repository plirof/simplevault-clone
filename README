SIMPLE VAULT - PASSWORD MANAGER

SimpleVault is a web-based tool that allows you to manage passwords 
or other secret information in a safe way. All secret information is 
encrypted using strong encryption algorithms. SimpleVault is particularly 
useful if you want to share secret information within a working group 
with trusted members.

INSTALLATION

Prerequisites are: PHP4 or PHP5 with the mcrypt library.

Download and unpack the SimpleVault package to the directory <install-dir>. 
By default, <install-dir>/vault/simplevault.txt is used as the vault file 
where all encrypted and unencrypted data is stored. This file should be 
readable and writeable by the web server. A different vault file can be 
configured in index.php in the variables $vaultdir and $vaultfile.

That's it. Go to <your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php and start creating 
entries.

In the default installation, the vault file contains 2 categories and 
4 entries for demonstration purposes. All entries are encrypted with 
the pass phrase 'toto'. You can delete the entries interactively, or 
by emptying the vault file.
