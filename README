SIMPLE VAULT - PASSWORD MANAGER

SimpleVault is a web-based tool that allows you to manage passwords 
or other secret information in a safe way. All secret information is 
encrypted using strong encryption algorithms. SimpleVault is particularly 
useful if you want to share secret information within a working group 
with trusted members.

INSTALLATION

Prerequisites are: PHP4 or PHP5 with the mcrypt library.

Download and unpack the SimpleVault package to the directory <install-dir>. 
By default, /var/lib/simplevault/simplevault.txt is used as the vault file 
where all encrypted and unencrypted data is stored. This file should be 
readable and writeable by the web server. 

NOTE: You must create the folder /var/lib/simplevault, and assign it permissions
so that your web server can read and write to that folder. If you are using  
shared hosting and don't have direct access to the web server, you can change
the location of the vault file to "vault/simplevault.txt". Ensure that this 
folder is not accessible from the internet!!

Several configuration options, including the path to the vault file, can
be overridden by editing svconfig.php. By default this file does not exist
but a sample configuration file exists in svconfig.php-dist.

That's it. Go to <your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php and start creating 
entries.

A sample vault file can be found in vault/simplevault.txt. This vault file
by default contains 2 categories and 4 entries for demonstration purposes.
All entries are encrypted with the pass phrase 'toto'. You can delete the
entries interactively, or by emptying the vault file.


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1) Always use a strong passphrase.

2) Ensure that your vault file is NOT accessible from the internet. If you
are installing simplevault on your own server, put the simplevault.txt file
in /var/lib/simplevault so that it is not accessible on the internet. If
you are using shared hosting, make sure the "vault" subdirectory is not
accessible from the internet by using .htaccess files, or by making the 
directory private or password protected using your web host's control panel.
